# README
This repository contains code files for an Object tracking and Following of a 4 wheeled vehicle. Also it includes a naive algorithm for Navigation of the vehicle called "The Artificial Potential Field Algo" . The vehicle was simulated in Webots, using Camera it could segment the obstacles locate the desired obstacle and move towards it. For the navigation Algorithm Lidar was used.
